plan for first hackathon:
- list all data structures and their uses/attributes, then see if any of them are usable on java and applicable to the project
- solve a linear equation that has tres variables
- come up with methods that can break down any equation and solve it 
- linear regression????
- also for extra practice, write down big O notation for chunky functions/loops and stuff
